# Twitter-Texting-Mining

Twitter is an American online news and social networking service on which users post and interact with messages known as “tweets”. As there exists a tremendous amount of unstructured data, the objectives of this study are:

• To deep dive into customer online behavior on Twitter, i.e., where they come from, what they talk about and where they go

• To identify the overall brand-wise sentiment on Twitter
